Feature: Supabase Project Setup
As a developer,
I want to create a new Supabase project named "MyTestProject"
So that I can start building an application with a backend and database.

Acceptance Criteria:
- A Supabase project named "MyTestProject" is successfully created.
- The project is created in the 'us-east-1' region.
- A secure database password ('CascadeSup@b3sT!') is used and noted.

Feature: User Database Creation
As a developer,
I want to set up a user database within the "MyTestProject" Supabase project
So that I can manage user profiles and application-specific user data.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Supabase's built-in `auth.users` table is available for authentication.
- A new table (e.g., 'profiles') is created to store additional user information.
- The 'profiles' table is linked to the `auth.users` table via a foreign key relationship (user_id).
- The 'profiles' table includes at least a 'username' and 'updated_at' field.
